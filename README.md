## 📌 Problem Statement
With the rapid expansion of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and IoT-enabled devices, unauthorized wireless usage has become a growing concern in environments such as examination halls, offices, and sensitive institutions. Existing jamming solutions block all signals indiscriminately, disrupting authorized communication and essential services.

There is a need for a selective, intelligent, and affordable system that can control unauthorized wireless activity without affecting legitimate users.

## 💡 Project Overview
The **Selective Signal Jammer for Civilian Applications** is a low-cost, intelligent signal control system designed to selectively restrict unauthorized wireless devices while allowing approved networks to function normally.

Unlike traditional jammers, the system focuses on **selective deauthentication** based on device identification, ensuring ethical and responsible operation suitable for civilian use.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- Selective handling of unauthorized wireless devices  
- Authorized networks remain unaffected  
- Operates in controlled indoor environments  
- Low power and portable design  
- Web-based user interface for monitoring  
- Budget-friendly prototype (~₹5,000)

---

## 🧠 Working Principle
- The system scans nearby wireless activity  
- Devices are identified using network-level characteristics  
- Unauthorized devices are selectively disconnected  
- Authorized devices continue normal operation  

This approach avoids unnecessary disruption and ensures responsible signal control.
